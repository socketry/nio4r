**New I/O for Ruby (nio4r)**: cross-platform asynchronous I/O primitives for
scalable network clients and servers. Modeled after the Java NIO API, but
simplified for ease-of-use.

**nio4r** provides an abstract, cross-platform stateful I/O selector API for Ruby.
I/O selectors are the heart of "reactor"-based event loops, and monitor
multiple I/O objects for various types of readiness, e.g. ready for reading or
writing.

## Projects using nio4r

* [ActionCable]: Rails 5 WebSocket protocol, uses nio4r for a WebSocket server
* [Celluloid]: Actor-based concurrency framework, uses nio4r for async I/O
* [Async]: Asynchronous I/O framework for Ruby
* [Puma]: Ruby/Rack web server built for concurrency

[ActionCable]: https://rubygems.org/gems/actioncable
[Celluloid]: https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-io
[Async]: https://github.com/socketry/async
[Puma]: https://github.com/puma/puma

## Goals

* Expose high-level interfaces for stateful IO selectors
* Keep the API small to maximize both portability and performance across many
  different OSes and Ruby VMs
* Provide inherently thread-safe facilities for working with IO objects

## Supported platforms

* Ruby 2.4
* Ruby 2.5
* Ruby 2.6
* Ruby 2.7
* Ruby 3.0
* [JRuby](https://github.com/jruby/jruby)
* [TruffleRuby](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby)

## Supported backends

* **libev**: MRI C extension targeting multiple native IO selector APIs (e.g epoll, kqueue)
* **Java NIO**: JRuby extension which wraps the Java NIO subsystem
* **Pure Ruby**: `Kernel.select`-based backend that should work on any Ruby interpreter

## Non-goals

**nio4r** is not a full-featured event framework like [EventMachine] or [Cool.io].
Instead, nio4r is the sort of thing you might write a library like that on
top of. nio4r provides a minimal API such that individual Ruby implementers
may choose to produce optimized versions for their platform, without having
to maintain a large codebase.
